# DiceRoller


## Features

### Single Dice Rolling
This is a dice roller made for EECS 776. I plan to use it when playing dungeons and dragons in the future. Currently the plan is to have an image for the six main dice with a text block underneath. The user can then enter a number of dice they want rolled and they will get the result in return. 

### Dice Strings
There will also be a text field that the user can enter dice strings into. For example, if the user wanted 3 four sided dice added to 5 twenty sided dice then they would enter "3d6+5d20".

### Api Access
Along with the UI with the pictures of dice, the user can also just make api calls to the endpoint that the front end uses. This will be located at [websitename.com]/roll/<diceString>.
